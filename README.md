# Detecting Archaic Introgression in African Genomes with AI-Assisted Pipelines

## Project Overview
This repository contains code, results, and notes from my independent research on archaic introgression in African genomes.  
I use datasets from:
- 1000 Genomes Project (Yoruba, Mende, etc.)
- Simons Genome Diversity Project
- Max Planck archaic genomes (Altai, Vindija Neanderthal, Denisovan)

## Methods
- Population genomics pipelines (PLINK, ADMIXTOOLS, VCFtools, bcftools)
- D-statistics, f-statistics, f₄-ratio tests
- PCA and allele frequency analysis
- Machine learning integration (Python, R)

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks with analyses (e.g., D-stats, PCA)  
- `scripts/` → Helper Python or R scripts  
- `results/` → Tables and text files with statistics  
- `figures/` → Plots and visualizations  

## Current Progress
Initial focus is Yoruba genomes (1000 Genomes) with D-statistics testing introgression.  
Further updates will include PCA plots, allele frequency distributions, and ML workflows.
